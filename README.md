Kick-off SASS (SCSS) library

- - -
***This library is still a WORK IN PROGRESS!***
- - -

##Usage

**Requires Sass 3.2 and Compass 0.13**

You need to import `compass/css3` to use helper mixins like `box-sizing(border-box)`. It is already imported in the `global.scss` so just don't comment it out.
